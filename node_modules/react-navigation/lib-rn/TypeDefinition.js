/**
 * Navigation State + Action
 */

/**
 * NavigationState is a tree of routes for a single navigator, where each child
 * route may either be a NavigationScreenRoute or a NavigationRouterRoute.
 * NavigationScreenRoute represents a leaf screen, while the
 * NavigationRouterRoute represents the state of a child navigator.
 *
 * NOTE: NavigationState is a state tree local to a single navigator and
 * its child navigators (via the routes field).
 * If we're in navigator nested deep inside the app, the state will only be the
 * state for that navigator.
 * The state for the root navigator of our app represents the whole navigation
 * state for the whole app.
